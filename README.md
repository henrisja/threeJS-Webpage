# threeJS Interactive Web Page

Using threeJS this loads in various animated blender models to an interactive web page and will play the animation as you mouse over the models. Additionally, the camera view can be modified by clicking and zooming on the web page. Can be served locally, just open index.html in a browser with CORS disabled. 

Eventually this will serve as an interactive homepage for my personal website.
